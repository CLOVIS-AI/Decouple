// By default, Composable functions cannot call Decouple components: they require the Components receiver.
// However, supplying the receiver manually (like we would do for regular extension functions) is not enough:
// some design systems need to initialize the app before working (e.g. creating CSS variablesâ€¦).
//
// To do this, you should call the 'Install' function:
//     Install(TheDesignSystemYouWantToUse) {
//         // Here, you can call Decouple components.
//     }

// For this demo, we have decided to let the user select between multiple design systems at run-time.
// This composable function is responsible for loading the design systems available on this platform,
// and selecting one, before calling 'Install'.
//
// If you are adapting this demo, and only use a single design system per platform, you can remove this function
// and call 'Install' directly when starting the app.
