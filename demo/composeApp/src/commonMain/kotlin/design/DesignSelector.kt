// By default, Composable functions cannot call Decouple components: they require the Components receiver.
// However, supplying the receiver manually (like we would do for regular extension functions) is not enough:
// some design systems need to initialize the app before working (e.g. creating CSS variablesâ€¦).
//
// To do this, you should call the 'Install' function:
//     Install(TheDesignSystemYouWantToUse) {
//         // Here, you can call Decouple components.
//     }

// For this demo, we have decided to let the user select between multiple design systems at run-time.
// This composable function is responsible for loading the design systems available on this platform,
// and selecting one, before calling 'Install'.
//
// If you are adapting this demo, and only use a single design system per platform, you can remove this function
// and call 'Install' directly when starting the app.
@Composable
fun InstallSelectedDesign(block: @Composable Components.() -> Unit) {
	val designSystems = remember { designSystems() }

	// For now, we just use the first one available.
	// In the future, we will add a way to choose.
	val currentDesignSystem = designSystems.first()

	Install(currentDesignSystem, block)
}

// To learn more about how each platform is initialized, see the places where InstallSelectedDesign is called.
// Tip: CTRL+click on the function name in IntelliJ.
