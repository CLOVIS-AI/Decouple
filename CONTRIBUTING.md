# Contribution guide

Thanks for wanting to contribute to the project!

There are many things we appreciate help with. The simplest is to [report problems](https://gitlab.com/opensavvy/decouple/-/issues/new) you see in the documentation or while using the project.

## Helping with development

> TL;DR in case you've done these things before:
>
> - The codebase is hosted in our [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/opensavvy/decouple).
> - You can contribute by forking the project, and submitting a merge request to us.
> - The codebase uses the official [Kotlin coding style](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html).
> - We name our commits using the [BrainDot style](https://gitlab.com/braindot/legal/-/blob/master/coding-style/STYLE_Git.md).
> - We organize our workflow using the [OpenSavvy Flow](https://gitlab.com/opensavvy/documents/-/blob/main/Documents/flow.md) (from the point of view of an occasional contributor, it is identical to the GitLab flow: merge requests are created against the `main` branch).
