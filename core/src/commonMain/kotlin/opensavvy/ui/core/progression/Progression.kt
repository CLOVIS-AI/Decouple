/**
 * Is work currently happening in a component?
 *
 * Modern applications are often highly asynchronous.
 * However, UI frameworks most often than not are oblivious to these background processes.
 * This causes UIs to feel slow and unresponsive, as the user is not aware of what is going on.
 *
 * OpenSavvy UI attempts to solve this problem at the component level, the closest place to the information.
 * A component that starts an asynchronous operation (e.g. a button) is called _responsible_ of that operation.
 * Depending on the UI implementation, this may be displayed to the user in a variety of ways (displaying a notification,
 * replacing the button by a loading spinnerâ€¦).
 *
 * The [Progression] sealed class is used to represent whether a component is responsible for an ongoing task.
 * Stateless variants of components that may the source of a long-running operation will accept a `progression: Progression` parameter.
 * Usually, the stateful variant of a component will not expose this parameter, and replace it by an asynchronous event lambda.
 *
 * There are two possible values to a [Progression] instance:
 * - [Done]: the component is not responsible for an ongoing task.
 * - [Loading]: the component is responsible for an ongoing task.
 *
 * Components that can be responsible for long-running operations will often accept callback parameters similar to
 * `suspend ReportProgression.() -> Unit`.
 * For more information about those, see [ReportProgression].
