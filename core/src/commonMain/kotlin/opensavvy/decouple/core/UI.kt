/**
 * A fully-featured UI implementation.
 *
 * This interface is the single entrypoint to the entire API.
 * All components are declared in superinterfaces of this one.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * First, you should get an instance of this interface.
 * Each implementation may do this differently, so read their documentation.
 *
 * Then, call its [Install] method:
 * ```kotlin
 * val ui: UI = // Your instance here
 * ui.Install {
 *     // you can use OpenSavvy UI components here
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Most components expect to be called within an `Install` call.
 * If this is not the case, they will throw an [IllegalStateException].
 *
 * ### Implementing your own design system
 *
 * This interface is a regular Kotlin interface, implementing it is the same as with any other interface.
 * However, we recommend that you:
 * - implement each component kind in its own interface using default methods,
 * - implement UI as an object or class that delegates to the various interfaces.
 *
 * For example, for a UI implementation called `Foo`, this could look like:
 * ```kotlin
 * interface FooButtons : Buttons {
 *     // implement your own buttons
 * }
 *
 * interface FooUI : UI, FooButtons {
 *     // customize Installâ€¦ if needed
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The rationale behind this pattern is:
 * - component kinds should not have state and interfaces cannot have state,
 * - it is easy for end users to override a single component,
 * - it is easy for end users to replace the implementation of a component kind by another one,
 * - you may provide multiple implementations of entire component kinds.
