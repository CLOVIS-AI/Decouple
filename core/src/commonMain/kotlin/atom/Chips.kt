/**
 * Actions and filters provided to the user.
 *
 * [Buttons] represent major actions that branch the flow of the application to somewhere else (confirmation, cancellation, starting a new screen).
 * Chips have an effect on the current screen (filtersâ€¦).
 *
 * Chips have three main slots:
 * - a `content` slot, which should most often be the text of the chip.
 * - an `icon` slot, which is a used to visually distinguish multiple chips from each other.
 * - an `action` slot, which is an icon used to identify what happens when the user interacts with the chip.
 *
 * It is recommended to only use one of `icon` and `action` to avoid information overload.
 *
 * The `contrasted` property can be set to `true` to increase the contrast of the chip.
 * This is useful if the cheap appears on an image or another pattern.
 * When appearing on a plain background, it should be set to `false`.
 *
 * Chips generally appear in [groups][ChipGroupSpec] of three or more elements.
