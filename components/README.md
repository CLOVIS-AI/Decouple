## Polymorphic components

Decouple is founded on the ability to switch the implementation of composable functions at runtime.
This allows creating business-level UI code that is design-less, but calls design-full UI code that can be replaced at any time.

The technical details of how this is implemented are explained in the "Polymorphic composables" module.
