# OpenSavvy UI

OpenSavvy UI is a multiplatform semantic UI framework.

**Multiplatform**: Available for websites targeting JS.
In the future, we will support desktop applications running on the JVM as well as Android, and maybe some native platforms too.

**Semantic**: OpenSavvy UI is a collection of interfaces that describe the behavior of various components of a basic design system (buttons, inputs, layoutsâ€¦) with no visual constraints.
It is made to be easy to implement for any design system you wish to use.
It is also easy to mix and match implementations and to replace components from an implementation by your own if you do not like them.

The ultimate goal is the ability to write your UI in common code that can then be compiled to whatever framework is native to the final device.
To make this possible, we standardize component behavior but leave unspecified the look and feel of components.
